FILEfox version 0.2.3  by Marat Nepomnyashy  maratbn@gmail  www.maratbn.com/FILEfox/

FILEfox is an open-source add-on / extension module for the popular open-source Mozilla Firefox web
browser.

FILEfox is a local file access proxy for JavaScript-based web applications running on Firefox.  It
gives these applications a civilized way to request manual user permission to load specific local
files for local analysis, in a fashion similar to the HTML form file upload, but the data does not
have to be uploaded to the web server.  This eliminates the age-old requirement that the user data
resides on remote server(s), enabling better privacy, and further opening the door to desktop
computing via web applications.

FILEfox remains dormant until a web application requests permission to load a file.  The request is
relayed to the user, who can approve or deny.  FILEfox notifies the user when the request is coming
through 3-rd party JavaScript.  Permission can be granted to load only one file at a time, and each
file is loaded only at the time the permission is granted.

For more information on how to utilize the FILEfox extension in your web application, see the
support website.

RELEASE HISTORY:

2010-06-19  version 0.2.3

Added method:       nsIFILEfox.isVersionAtLeast(...)

                    Returns 'true' if the version of the currently installed FILEfox extension is
                    at least the version specified.

Added method:       nsIFILEfoxTextFileRead.getLineStripped(...)

                    Returns a single line out of the text file, stripped of the whitespace bounding
                    it.

Added method:       nsIFILEfoxTextFileRead.getTokenOnLine(...)

                    Returns a single non-whitespace token with the index specified on the line with
                    the index specified.

Added method:       nsIFILEfoxTextFileRead.getTotalTokensOnLine(...)

                    Returns the total number of non-whitespace tokens on the line with the index
                    specified.


2010-04-28  version 0.2.2

Initial release

Contains method:    nsIFILEfox.getVersion()

                    Returns the version of the currently installed FILEfox extension.

Contains method:    nsIFILEfox.requestLoadASCIIFile(...)

                    Causes the FILEfox extension to request from the user to manually select an
                    ASCII text file to load.  Upon user approval FILEfox will initiate a Mozilla-
                    internal synchroneous file loading routine via XPCOM, and then return the file
                    contents in a data object corresponding to the 'nsIFILEfoxTextFileRead'
                    interface, or a falsy value on failure.

                    The returned data object should be assigned to a private local variable inside
                    the calling function and later accessed via closure to prevent exposing it to
                    other scripts on the page.

Contains property:  nsIFILEfoxTextFile.encoding

                    The encoding with which this text file is encoded.

Contains property:  nsIFILEfoxTextFile.totalLines

                    Total number of lines in the text file.

                    The text file is stored line by line rather than in a single string, as
                    otherwise a huge file in a huge string would overwhelm the browser's JavaScript
                    engine.

Contains function:  nsIFILEfoxTextFile.getLine(...)

                    Returns a single line out of the text file, including the line termination
                    carriage return character sequence.

Contains property:  nsIFILEfoxTextFileRead.totalChars

                    Total number of characters in the text file.
