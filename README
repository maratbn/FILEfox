FILEfox version 0.2.2  by Marat Nepomnyashy  maratbn@gmail  www.maratbn.com/FILEfox/

FILEfox is an open-source add-on / extension module for the popular open-source Mozilla Firefox web
browser.

FILEfox is a local file access proxy for JavaScript-based web applications running on Firefox.  It
gives these applications a civilized way to request manual user permission to load specific local
files for local analysis, in a fashion similar to the HTML form file upload, but the data does not
have to be uploaded to the web server.  This eliminates the age-old requirement that the user data
resides on remote server(s), enabling better privacy, and further opening the door to desktop
computing via web applications.

FILEfox remains dormant until a web application requests permission to load a file.  The request is
relayed to the user, who can approve or deny.  FILEfox notifies the user when the request is coming
through 3-rd party JavaScript.  Permission can be granted to load only one file at a time, and each
file is loaded only at the time the permission is granted.

For more information on how to utilize the FILEfox extension in your web application, see the
support website.
