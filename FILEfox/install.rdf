        FILEfox local file proxy for web applications running on FireFox.

        FILEfox gives JavaScript-based web applications a civilized way to request manual user permission to load specific local files for local analysis.
        This eliminates the traditional requirement for the data to reside on remote web server(s), enabling better privacy, and further opening the door to desktop computing via web applications.
        This is similar to the traditional HTML form file upload mechanism, but the data is fed directly to a JavaScript callback function, and does not have to be uploaded to the server, unless the JavaScript does so intentionally.
        Web applications ask for permission via this extension.  Permission can be granted to load only one file at a time, and each file is loaded only at the time the permission is granted.

        WARNING:  MALICIOUS WEB APPLICATIONS MAY UPLOAD ANY DATA AVAILABLE TO MALICIOUS SERVERS.
        ONLY USE THIS EXTENSION WITH THE WEBSITES YOU TRUST.
        DO NOT USE THIS EXTENSION TO OPEN FILES FOR PHISHING WEBSITES.
        DO NOT USE THIS EXTENSION TO OPEN FILES FOR WEBSITES THAT ALLOW ARBITRARY 3-RD PARTY JAVASCRIPT APPLICATIONS (SUCH AS FACEBOOK).
        DO NOT USE THIS EXTENSION TO OPEN FILES CONTAINING DATA SUCH AS AUTHENTICATION, OPERATING SYSTEM CONFIGURATION, OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

        ** RECOMMENDED FOR EXPERIENCED USERS ONLY **
