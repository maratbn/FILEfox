FILEfox.disclamer = \
FILEfox is an open-source add-on / extension module for the popular open-source Mozilla Firefox web browser.  \
\r\n\r\n\
FILEfox gives JavaScript-based web applications a civilized way to request manual user permission to load specific local files for local analysis, in a fashion similar to the traditional HTML form file upload.  \
This eliminates the traditional requirement for the data to reside on remote web server(s), enabling better privacy, and further opening the door to desktop computing via web applications.  \
\r\n\r\n\
FILEfox remains dormant until a web application requests permission to load a file.  \
The request is relayed to the user, who can approve or deny.  \
Permission can be granted to load only one file at a time, and each file is loaded only at the time the permission is granted.  \
\r\n\r\n\
For more information on how to utilize the FILEfox extension in your web application, see the support website.  \
